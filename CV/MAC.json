I love mentoring people, it's the easiest way to be a better professional.\nHaving workmates who inspire you is important.\n\nGood practices are a must too. During my last year working in tech, I was using TDD approach (so many times as I could), doing code reviews and discussing possible solutions with the rest of the team.\n\nRegarding remote jobs, I prefer remote positions but having a co-working place or offices where I can go to work is a nice thing."
